Step-by-step recipe for Tatar balish

1. Prepare_the_dough_for_the_pie
The flour should be sifted into a bowl. Add baking powder and salt to it.
Melt and cool the butter, sour cream and kefir should be mixed together with it.

First, mix with a spoon, then knead a soft elastic dough with your hands. If it gets too sticky, flour will help you.

Wrap in foil and refrigerate the dough for at least 30 minutes.

2. Prepare_the_filling 
the beginning, cut the meat into small cubes (1x1 cm) or chop it slightly.

Peel the potatoes and cut them into small cubes.

chop the onion finely so that it is evenly distributed over the bales.

In a deep bowl, combine the meat, potatoes, onions, add salt and ground black pepper. If desired, add the melted butter for extra juiciness.

3. Form_balesh
a ball, Divide the dough into two parts: one about 2/3 (base), the other smaller (lid).

Next, the base should be rolled out into a layer about 1 cm thick, laid out in a mold so that the dough covers both the bottom and the sides.

All the filling should be evenly distributed.

Roll out the remaining dough — this is the "lid" of the bales. Cover the filling, pinch the edges with the base so that there is a sealed seam.

In the center of the top layer, make a hole with a diameter of 1.5–2 cm. Roll up a small ball of dough and insert it into the hole as a "plug".

4. Bake_balesh
the bales in a preheated 180°C oven for 40 minutes.

After 40-50 minutes, carefully remove the stopper and pour in the meat broth (or hot water) — this will make the bales juicier and richer.

Reduce the temperature to 150-160°C and bake for another 1.5–2 hours. Important: if the top of the lid is blushing, cover it with foil or parchment.

Remove the finished bales, cool slightly, cover with a towel. Let the balish "walk" for 15-20 minutes — this way the taste will become more harmonious.

Cook with all your heart, let the Tatar balash become your family tradition and a source of warm memories. Enjoy your meal!
