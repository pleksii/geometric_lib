Step-by-step {{recipe_key}} for Tatar balish

{{one}}. {{first_step}}
The {{balesh_flour_key}} should be sifted into a bowl. Add baking powder and {{balesh_salt_key}} to it.
Melt and cool the {{balesh_butter_key}}, sour cream and {{balesh_kefir_key}} should be mixed together with it.

First, mix with a spoon, then knead a soft elastic dough with your hands. If it gets too sticky, {{balesh_flour_key}} will help you.

Wrap in foil and refrigerate the dough for at least 30 minutes.

{{two}}. {{second_step}} 
the beginning, cut the meat into small cubes (1x1 cm) or chop it slightly.

Peel the {{balesh_potatoes_key}} and cut them into small cubes.

chop the {{balesh_onion_key}} finely so that it is evenly distributed over the bales.

In a deep bowl, combine the meat, {{balesh_potatoes_key}}, onions, add {{balesh_salt_key}} and ground black pepper. If desired, add the melted {{balesh_butter_key}} for extra juiciness.

{{three}}. {{third_step}}
a ball, Divide the dough into two parts: one about {{two}}/{{three}} ({{base_key}}), the other smaller (lid).

Next, the {{base_key}} should be rolled out into a layer about {{one}} cm thick, laid out in a mold so that the dough covers both the bottom and the sides.

All the {{balesh_filling_key}} should be evenly distributed.

Roll out the remaining dough — this is the "lid" of the bales. Cover the {{balesh_filling_key}}, pinch the edges with the {{base_key}} so that there is a sealed seam.

In the center of the {{top_key}} layer, make a hole with a diameter of {{one}}.5–{{two}} cm. Roll up a small ball of dough and insert it into the hole as a "plug".

{{four}}. {{fourth_step}}
the bales in a preheated 180°C oven for 40 minutes.

After 40-50 minutes, carefully remove the stopper and pour in the meat broth (or hot water) — this will make the bales juicier and richer.

Reduce the temperature to 150-160°C and bake for another {{one}}.5–{{two}} hours. Important: if the {{top_key}} of the lid is blushing, cover it with foil or parchment.

Remove the finished bales, cool slightly, cover with a towel. Let the balish "walk" for 15-20 minutes — this way the taste will become more harmonious.

Cook with all your heart, let the Tatar balash become your family tradition and a source of warm memories. Enjoy your meal!
