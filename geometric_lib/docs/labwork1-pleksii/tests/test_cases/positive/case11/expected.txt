Hello, Vladimir.
This is the 1st test.
It is pretty complex.
Adding _ has never been so useful before

I do can write single braces like {this}. But if I wanna write double, I'll be just sad with no double braces.

Remember, that keys are sensitive_to_case, so Andrew and Vladimir are different keys.

I can also use templates in the way like this 
and there should not be any whitespaces or line breaks excluding that one after double_braces_right. 
Oh, let's repeat whitespaces but whithout whitespaces.


                Sometimes text 
        can be
            really strange formatted.
    It can             contain key_words_inside_words and it's still available.
Remember
    that
                your utility 
                            mustn't change 
                                formatting.
