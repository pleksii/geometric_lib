Hello, {{ name }}.
This is the {{ number }} test.
It is pretty {{ difficulty }}.
Adding {{       just_word    }} has never been so useful {{ time }}

I do can write single braces like {this}. But if I wanna write double, I'll be just sad with no double braces.

Remember, that keys are {{ SenSiTiVe_to_Case }}, so {{ Name }} and {{ name }} are different keys.

I can also use templates in the way like {{abacaba               }} 
and there should not be any {{ whitespaces }} or line breaks excluding that one after double_braces_right. 
Oh, let's repeat {{whitespaces}} but whithout {{ whitespaces}}.


                Sometimes text 
        can be
            really {{type}} formatted.
    It can             contain key_words{{inside}}words and it's still {{availability}}.
Remember
    that
                your {{          project_type     }} 
                            mustn't change 
                                formatting.
